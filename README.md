# Predictive Analysis on Urban Traffic Management

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing predictive analytics to enhance urban traffic management. By analyzing historical traffic data, the goal is to forecast traffic patterns, identify congestion points, and provide actionable insights for city planners and commuters.

## Dataset

The dataset employed in this project includes:

- **Traffic Volume Counts**: Detailed records of vehicle counts at various urban locations over specified time intervals.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Cleaning**: Addressed missing or inconsistent data entries.
   - **Normalization**: Standardized data to ensure uniformity across all records.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized traffic trends over time.
   - Identified peak traffic hours and high-congestion zones.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implemented time-series forecasting models, such as ARIMA and Prophet, to predict future traffic volumes.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. **Visualization**:
   - Developed interactive dashboards to display current traffic conditions and future forecasts.

## Results

The predictive models achieved:

- **ARIMA Model**: MAE of X and RMSE of Y.
- **Prophet Model**: MAE of A and RMSE of B.

These results indicate the models' effectiveness in forecasting urban traffic patterns.
